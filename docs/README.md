### Alumna Framework: Development for Humans

Alumna is a **front-end framework** and its goal is to make universal app development as **human-friendly** as possible. Nevertheless, besides the easiness, we also consider high performance and safety.

See the [Install and first run](install.md) for more details and getting started.
